<p>Originally from country South Australia, I moved to Queensland to pursue bigger and better things. I met my husband here and I am now mum of 2 young boys.</p>

<p>I have recently completed Certification in Accounting and Bookkeeping and I am excited to grow my knowledge and experience in the accounting industry.</p>

<p>I love being near the water and enjoy morning walks along the coast and spending time with my family.</p>
