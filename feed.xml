          <title>JobKeeper Payment Access</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/jobkeeper-payment.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many businesses do not pay the business owners a wage and therefore are not officially considered to be employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest assured that the Government has taken this into consideration when determining who can access the JobKeeper Payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now know that the following individuals will be eligible for the JobKeeper Payment in addition to employees: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ONE partner in a partnership;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ONE beneficiary of a trust;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ONE director or shareholder of a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in this position, are eligible for the JobKeeper payments, apply for the payments, then need to make these JobKeeper Payments to the business owner, they need to be paid through Single Touch Payroll (STP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may require payroll assistance if you do not currently pay employees.  You will need to set up a STP payroll system and use the payroll codes that the Tax Office require for these payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your professional bookkeeper will be able to assist you through this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you require further information, please do not hesitate to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>JobKeeper Applications Open Tomorrow: 20 April 2020</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/jobkeeper-payment.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a business owner (sole trader, partnership, trust or company) and your business has been affected by the Coronavirus, the JobKeeper payment is available to your business if you meet the eligibility requirements.  Here are the steps to apply if you determine that you are eligible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 1 – Register your interest and subscribe for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudtaxaccountants.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b184f456b69f2ebfa6a540c96&amp;amp;id=59ec03e5b9&amp;amp;e=711ec601d7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JobKeeper payment&lt;/a&gt; updates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 2 – Check you and your employees meet the eligibility requirements.  This step is vital.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 3 – Continue to pay at least $1,500 to each eligible employee per JobKeeper fortnight (the first JobKeeper fortnight is the period from 30 March to 12 April).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 4 – Notify your eligible employees that you are intending to claim the JobKeeper payment on their behalf and check they aren’t claiming JobKeeper payment through another employer or have nominated through another business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 5 – Send the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudtaxaccountants.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b184f456b69f2ebfa6a540c96&amp;amp;id=f272765d51&amp;amp;e=711ec601d7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JobKeeper employee nomination notice&lt;/a&gt; to your nominated employees to complete and return to you by the end of April if you plan to claim the JobKeeper payment for April. Keep it on file and provide a copy to your registered tax agent if you are using one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following steps can be followed from tomorrow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 6 – From 20 April 2020, you can enrol with us for the JobKeeper payment using the Business Portal and authenticate with myGovID. You must do this by the end of April to claim the JobKeeper payments for April.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 7 – In the online form, provide your bank details and indicate if you are claiming an entitlement based on business participation, for example if you are a sole trader.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step 8 – Specify the estimated number of employees who will be eligible for the first JobKeeper fortnight (30 March – 12 April) and the second JobKeeper fortnight (13 April – 26 April).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will need to make a declaration that you meet the eligibility requirements to receive these payments, you must keep a thorough record of how you determined your eligibility.  If incorrect declarations are made and you do not meet the eligibility requirements, you will need to repay the JobKeeper Payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you require any assistance when you prepare your applications, please do not hesitate to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Government Announced Mandatory Code for Rent Relief</title>
          <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;prime-minister-scott-morrison-has-revealed-that-it-has-reached-an-agreement-on-a-mandatory-code-for-the-provision-of-rent-relief-by-commercial-landlords-to-tenants&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime Minister Scott Morrison has revealed that it has reached an agreement on a mandatory code for the provision of rent relief by commercial landlords to tenants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a press conference today, Mr Morrison said the mandatory code will be legislated and regulated as appropriate in each state and territory jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the code will apply to tenancies where the tenant or landlord is eligible for the JobKeeper program and where they have a turnover of $50 million or less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The code is designed to support those small and medium sized enterprises, be they a tenant or indeed a landlord,” Mr Morrison said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The code brings together a set of good faith leasing principles. Landlords must not terminate the lease or draw on a tenant’s security. Likewise, tenants must honour the lease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Morrison said landlords will be required to reduce rent proportionate to the trading reduction in the tenant’s business through a combination of waivers of rent and deferrals of rents over the course of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said waivers of rent must account for at least 50 per cent of the reduction in the rental provided to the tenant during that period, while deferrals must be covered over the balance of the lease term and in a period no less than 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: SMSF Advisor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Legislation has not yet been passed and no additional details are currently available. &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Discretionary Trusts &amp; JobKeeper Payment Access</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Many small businesses operate under a Discretionary Trust structure where the business owners take Distributions rather than Wages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Trust’s may have employees and those employees are paid wages, potentially making the employer eligible for the JobKeeper payment in respect to those employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what about the business owners themselves?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If their business has seen a decrease in turnover, potentially down to $0, these business owners cannot pay themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all of the payments that have been announced under the stimulus packages, they are currently ineligible personally for these payments as they are not an employee and they are not a sole trader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how are these business owners meant to pay themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many discussions with my peers in this industry, it is very clear that there is no guidance on this at all. Just speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at a bit of a loss on how to find out more information so I contacted the office of Andrew Laming MP to bring this to his attention as this effects so many local businesses. I also contacted my professional body, CPA Australia for this same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, CPA Australia has not come back to me just yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Andrew Laming MP was kind enough to phone me this morning. I explained the circumstance that many of my clients are facing and he asked me to provide him with a written example of what I was referring to so that he could discuss the matter with Treasury. Mr Laming came back to me late this afternoon as he was able to have those discussions with Treasury today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Laming has confirmed that this isn’t a matter that has been legislated on yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As frustrating as it may be not to have this legislation, what it means is that you can rest assured that we aren’t missing vital information at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once legislation is passed, hopefully over the next week or so, we will be able to advise precisely if trust beneficiaries are entitled to these payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be in touch with all of our clients that operate their businesses out of a Discretionary Trust as soon as legislation is passed.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Job Keepers Payment</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Scott Morrison has just announced a $130 billion support package to help employers and employees. The idea behind these measures is that employers will retain their employees and have them working where they can.  However, if there is no work available due to Coronavirus related downturn or closures, then these employers retain their employees on this payment for up to six months so that employees stay connected to their employers. Although this has not yet been passed in legislation, here are some of the details that are expected to apply to this package. There will be a $1,500 per fortnight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This will be paid to the employer, who will then pay their employee;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An individual cannot received the Job Seekers Payment as well as the Job Keepers Payment;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is a flat rate for everyone;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This applies to full time workers, part time workers, sole traders and casual employees that have been with their employer for more than 12 months;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any employee that has been stood down from 1 March 2020 can be eligible for these payments;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payments will be made from 1 May 2020 onwards, however, they will be backdated to today, 30 March 2020;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employers can start making these payments as of today from their own funds, and they will be reimbursed back to today’s date;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every business will be eligible where they have seen a decrease in turnover of 30% of more (50% if your business turnover is more than $1.1 billion);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employers must register with the Tax Office to receive these payments (businesses can do this themselves directly on the ATO website, alternatively your bookkeeper can provide assistance, if you do not utilise the services of a bookkeeper, your accountant can provide this assistance);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ATO will have a registration button on their website &lt;a href=&quot;http://ato.gov.au/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ato.gov.au&lt;/a&gt; very soon;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Single Touch Payroll system will be used to process payments to employees;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Zealander’s on a 444 Visa will be eligible for these payments;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is intended to be a scheme that lasts for up to six months;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employers can top up their employees wages;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no Super Guarantee paid on this payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PM Morrison has announced that this legislation will take at least a week to draft and hopefully Parliament will sit next week to finalise and pass this fantastic measure.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Fact Sheet: First Home Loan Deposit Scheme</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The First Home Loan Deposit Scheme is an Australian Government initiative to support eligible first home buyers purchase a home sooner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Scheme, part of an eligible first home buyer’s home loan from a participating lender will be guaranteed by NHIFC. This is aimed at enabling first home buyers to purchase a home with a deposit of as little as 5 per cent (lender’s criteria apply).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to find out more, have a read of the &lt;a href=&quot;/uploads/fact-sheet-first-home-loan-deposit-scheme-261119.pdf&quot;&gt;this fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; and visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhfic.gov.au/what-we-do/fhlds/&quot;&gt;https://www.nhfic.gov.au/what-we-do/fhlds/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MyGovID is the new way of proving who you are online and is required to unlock certain government online services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This replaces your AUSkey which will no longer be accessible from the end of March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://fit-tundra.cloudvent.net/contact/&quot;&gt;contact our office&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to book in one of these appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
